This will just be a simple form to fill out a game of football.

You'll enter two team names, a home and visitor team.

Then you'll click some buttons to add field goals and touch downs.

Click a button, and it will submit the form to the `scoreboard-api` project!

# Getting started

## Angular 2

`npm run angular2` -> builds angular2 with webpack in `app/angular2` and serves index.html in that directory

## React

`npm run react` -> builds react with browserify in `app/react` and serves index.html in that directory

# Sass

`npm run sass` - compiles bootstrap-sass into styles.css.
